## Video about the app:

## Consept:
The original idea around this app is to make a game where the player hits a small box in a random location as fast as possible. This would have tested the player on both speed, accuracy and percision. Then have the times displayed on a leaderboard.

## Reflection:
This app does not work. I had the idea to try to make something that was a bit of a streach, but it I did not complete it in the time allowed. the backend and deployment gave me such a hassel that each became just a time sink. If I could change something about my project it would be that I just do someting basic like a book library or store. Sadly, this effort will probably cost me my grade. However, at the very least it was worth a try. Just to get my site functioning required me to learn so many additional things that I sorta burnt myself out. Furthermore, I already know that I am not that great at web design. I am much better at breaking things than I am at making them.

## What's Next:
I might conitue this app eventually, I put so much effort into it that is want to see it finished. It will be a while though. Pushing data to backend and heroku not allowing or erroring everyting has really stressed my out. After, a break and if my grade does not tramatize me Ill probably try slowly completeing it.


## Script for the video:
This web app is a simple application where you test your reaction speed and pits you time against others. This app will test you reaction time, but really it is a game. For entertainment purposes you can see how extra ordinary or ordinary you are.

Here we have the welcome page to let you know what it was is. It is a simple minimalise design. With the current leaderboard at the bottom here. There is not user loggin.

This is the game. The Idea is when the box turns green the player hits the box and the time from when the box turn green to the player input is your recorded reaction time. hit the box to fast and you wont have a viable score for the leaderboard.

This last page is the leaderboad where you can add you time to the board. 

That is it! Hitbox! Thank you.
